# Guess My Number Game

## Overview

This project is a Python-based number-guessing game. It includes two main game modes, difficulty levels, and a system for storing game results in an Excel file. It was developed as part of a programming module practice, demonstrating key programming concepts in Python.

## Features

### 1.	Game Modes:
	•	Single-player Mode: The number to guess is generated randomly by the computer.
	•	Two-player Mode: One player enters a number, and the other player attempts to guess it.
### 2.	Difficulty Levels:
	•	Easy: 20 attempts.
	•	Medium: 12 attempts.
	•	Hard: 5 attempts.
### 3.	Customizable Range: The number to guess is between 1 and 1000 by default, but it can be adjusted to another maximum range as desired.
### 4.	Statistics: Game results are saved to an Excel file, and basic statistics are displayed:
	•	Number of wins and losses.
	•	Number of games played by a particular player.

## Requirements

	•	Python 3.7 or higher.
	•	Required libraries listed in requirements.txt.

## Installation

### 1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Gloriuss/guess_my_number.git
### 2.	Navigate to the project directory:
cd guess-my-number
### 3.	Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
### 4.	Activate the virtual environment:
	On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
	On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
### 5.	Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
### 1.	Launch the game:
python game.py
### 2.	Menu Options:
	•	1 - Single-player Mode: Guess a number generated by the computer.
	•	2 - Two-player Mode: One player enters a number to guess, and the second player tries to guess it.
	•	3 - Statistics: Shows the game results stored in the Excel file.
	•	4 - Exit: Ends the game.
### 3.	Difficulty Selection:
	•	After selecting a game mode, choose a difficulty level:
	•	Easy: 20 attempts.
	•	Medium: 12 attempts.
	•	Hard: 5 attempts.
### 4.	Playing the Game:
	•	For each attempt, the game will indicate whether the guess is too high or too low.
	•	If you guess the number within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose and will be taken back to the main menu.
### 5.	Statistics:
	•	Shows the number of wins and losses, or the number of games played by a specific player.

## Additional Configuration

The Excel file path for storing game results is defined relatively in the code. Ensure that records.xlsx is located in the same directory as game.py.
